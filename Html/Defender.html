<p>For defenders the prep phaze is one of the most important time in the game, where you will setup site to your team's liking. There are many comboes you can do with the different defender operators to make the site even stronger, and obviously it would depend on what map you'r on. You'll also have to destroy drones while your setting up site, unless there is a solis in the team because her gadget is perfect against drones. </p>
<p>There are some operators you would like to have in the team as such as bandit or kaid because they will be able to counter people who try to breach the walls and will destroy those utilities. Mute can also work as such operator but it wont destroy their utlities instead just wastes time, and his mute jammers are very handy against drones and other electronic stuff the enemy might use. </p> 
<p>As defender there are also different type as such as roamers, they will spend most of their time outside the site, can be far and can be near. These roamers job is to waste as much time as possible for the enemy to be able to do something. Having a couple of roamers can be handy but having way to many can make the site way to vulnerable letting the enemy to have an easier time, unless some of the roamers are playing above the site and making vert holes you can attack from.  </p>
