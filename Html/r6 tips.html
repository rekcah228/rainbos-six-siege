<p>This site will give some tips and techniques that can be useful to find out when playing Rainbow Six siege. And it will be divided by two categories: attacker and defender, where I will focus on them separately and tell how you can improve. This first page, however, will tell you how you can improve as a player.  </p>



<p>First of all you will have to improve your recoil control, same with your aim. Which i suggest practicing in the firing range. You should also be minded of using your operators utility as much as you can and when necessary ofcourse, so it becomes easier for you and your team to defend aswell as attack. If there is any reason you dont understand what your operator can do, you can always try them out in a custom game or look at the ability guide you can find while looking at the operator.   </p>
