		<p>In the beginning of the round you first gotta drone and find the site and scan the operators the enemey is using and change your operator to a counter or someone well versed for the match your in. After it's a good idea to try to find any roamers before entering the building and eliminating them first if you possible can, you dont want them to suprise attack you later in the round.		</p>
		<p>There are also some operators you would have to take in mind to keep in the team as such as hard breachers to open up the site more and add pressure to the enemy. If they have electrified the reinforced walls with bandit or kaid it will best to have someone with emp grenades, thatcher is the best in this situation. </p>
        <p>When attacking you will also want to keep your drones safe as possible while scanning the site, if every oponent is scanned there is no reason to put your drone in danger and can just keep it outside the building so you can pick it up and use it for later. You could even use your drones as a flank drone or sound que drone, with a flank drone you put down somewhere behind you so your teammate if spectating can watch it for the round to keep your back safe. Sound que drones however, you keep the drone in a safe ish spot but near the enemy so you can hear their footsteps and whatnot. </p>
